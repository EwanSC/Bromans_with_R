Working with R to handle epigraphic and GIS data for my PhD project. Some related epigraphic and archaeological data can be found at my [BromansCoopey Repo](https://github.com/EwanSC/BromansCoopey).

Programs: RStudio <br/>
Programming: R <br/>
Desktop: Dell Inspiron 15 7000 <br/>

Some of the outputs so far:

![Scatter map of all locations where Roman epigraphy has been found in Dalmatia. The modern regions conprising Dalmatia are blue on this map, and the inscriptions are marked by orange dots which scatter the landscape, clustering along the adriatic coastline](https://github.com/EwanSC/Bromans_with_R/blob/master/all_Dalmatia_map.png)

![Scatter map of all locations where more than 30 and less than 1000 pieces of roman epigraphy have been found in Dalmatia. The modern regions conprising Dalmatia are light green on this map, and the inscriptions are marked by transparent black dots which scatter the landscape in various sizes, clustering along the adriatic coastline](https://github.com/EwanSC/Bromans_with_R/blob/master/30-1000_Dalmatia_scaledplots.png)
