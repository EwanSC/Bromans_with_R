# Bromans_with_R
Working with R to handle epigraphic and GIS data for my PhD project. Some related epigraphic and archaeological data can be found at my [BromansCoopey Repo](https://github.com/EwanSC/BromansCoopey) or at [zenodo.7052901](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7052901).

## Example outputs:
