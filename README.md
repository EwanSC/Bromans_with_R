# Bromans_with_R
Working with R to handle epigraphic and GIS data for my PhD project. Some related epigraphic and archaeological data can be found at my [BromansCoopey Repo](https://github.com/EwanSC/BromansCoopey) or at [zenodo.7052901](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7052901).

## Example outputs:

![scaled scatter map of the distribution of military monuments in roman dalmatia. title reads Epigraphic Distribution of the Military in Dalmatia, subtitle reads Undated Monuments and Monuments Dated 30 BCE–150 CE. x-axis goes from 12 east to 22 east. y-axis goes from 41 north to 46 and a half north. map is of the eastern Adriatic coastline. Key consists of 4 orange circles increasing in size, with the smallest representing 25, the second 50, the third 75, and the last 100.](output_images/dated_military_scatter.jpeg)
